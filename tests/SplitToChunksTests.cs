                "Hitori Gotoh (後ご藤とう ひとり Gotō Hitori), an extremely timid and introverted first-year student in high school often referred by her bandmates as Bocchi-chan (ぼっちちゃん),[2] is the titular main protagonist of the manga and anime series, Bocchi the Rock!. She is in the first year of Shuka High School and is in charge of the guitar and lyrics of the band, Kessoku Band. She aspires to perform in a band that could showcase even a reserved girl's talent, hence she began playing the guitar. Although her skill is the real deal, she struggles to exhibit it proficiently in a band or in front of an audience.

In her uniform, she usually wears a pink tracksuit with a long gray pleated skirt, black socks, and brown shoes as part of her style. Ironically, she surprisingly has a large bust (shown in the manga); this is most likely because she dresses in baggy clothing. Personality Hitori is an extremely introverted girl with high social anxiety, making it very difficult for her to talk to strangers. She often tries to avoid interactions, even performing her first live house show from inside a cardboard mango box.[8] Because of her introversion, she rarely goes outside and instead spends most of her time at home, playing the guitar alone in a dark closet. She seeks praise from others, likely as a reaction to her personality. She started playing the guitar to become a music star for the sole reason of being admired. She sometimes attempts to socialize, often in unusual ways, such as mimicking how others talk. However, these attempts often fail. Plot History Hitori started playing the guitar in her first year of middle school and improved her skills by practicing six hours daily. Although, after she had graduated from middle school and begun attending Shuka High School, she still had no friends at the start of the series.[9] Volume 1 Hitori was playing her guitar in her house while lamenting in an internal monologue about how she was on the brink of becoming a hikikomori, a shut off from society due to her social issues. She found comfort in the comments people left on her \"guitarhero\" video channel, but when someone suggested she perform live, her motivation dropped. She thought back to her middle school days when she tried and failed to make friends through her love for \"rock\". She dreamed of forming a band and performing live, but it seemed like a distant fantasy. The next day, she showed up at Shuka High School with her guitar and band merchandise, but no one seemed interested. Feeling down, she wandered around Shimokitazawa, ending up on a swing in a nearby playground, and bemoaned her bad luck. Suddenly, a girl approached her, and she introduced herself as Nijika Ijichi. Noticing her guitar, she asked Hitori to be a substitute for their band's recent runaway guitarist. Hitori reluctantly agreed and Nijika took her to a live house called STARRY. On the way, Nijika rambled on about herself, making it hard for Hitori to listen. But when Nijika mentioned the \"guitarhero\" channel and how she wished to play with the creator, Hitori was surprised and grateful that someone liked her work. When they arrived in STARRY, Nijika introduced Hitori to Ryo Yamada, who was already inside.[10] The live house and its staff were so gloomy that Hitori was afraid and hid in a trash can. When they started to practice, Hitori was very bad, which dampened her motivation despite her impressive performances as guitarhero. To boost her confidence, Ryo suggested that she hide in a mango box to calm down, and surprisingly worked. She felt much better and was able to perform well in the live show. Ryo also explained the band's name, Kessoku Band, and gave her the nickname \"Bocchi(-chan).\" Although Hitori was just in a box, she felt optimistic playing with the band and believed that improving her social skills was crucial to showcasing her potential as guitarhero.[11] On the following day, Bocchi shared with the band her avoidance of people, revealing how she travels 2 hours to school to avoid meeting anyone she knows, and how happy songs make her feel like she is missing out on youth. When Nijika brought up the band's financial situation and the need to work part-time, Bocchi was hesitant to give up her savings and feared the idea of working. Nijika then offered her a job at the live house instead, which Bocchi reluctantly accepted but still searched for the odds of winning the lottery to avoid her responsibility.[12] On her first day of work, Bocchi tried to skip it by resorting to bathing in cold water and sitting in front of a blowing fan but failed. Her nervousness gets in the way even right before she entered the live house until the manager noticed her and got her mistaken as a customer. The whole day passed with a lot of mishaps on her part, but it went well nevertheless, and Nijika compliments her for taking a step forward. She managed to get herself excited for the next day, but her excitement for the next day was ruined by a fever that struck her at the wrong time.[13] She came back to school frustrated with her anxiety hindering her communication until she stumbled upon a cheerful girl. She tried getting her attention to get the girl to join her band but ended up running away herself. After a proper explanation, Kita initially declined due to her previous experience with a certain band but asked Bocchi if she could teach her guitar. Bocchi agreed and even brought Kita to her part-time job, only to discover that it was at the very same live house where her old band played and where the former Kessoku Band vocalist quit.[14] Despite feeling overwhelmed by Kita's presence when she joined the crew on her job, Bocchi showed her the ropes on the job and they developed a mutual understanding. Finally, Kita rejoined the band.[15] In the following events, Bocchi \"enjoyed\" teaching Kita how to play the guitar, working her part-time job, and having photoshoots with the group.[16] The band asked her to write lyrics for a new song, but Bocchi struggled to come up with an idea that she was satisfied with. After receiving guidance from Ryo, she finally finished the lyrics, which the band liked and approved of.[17] When Seika puts the band for their upcoming live performance, the band passed, but Bocchi became overwhelmed and vomited due to the stress. Seika saw this and offered constructive criticism to her, commenting such as that she often looks down, hoping to help Bocchi improve, but Bocchi misinterpreted her comments as a threat.[18] Bocchi encounters a dead end when trying to sell her tickets for their performance. She finds herself reflecting on her situation where suddenly she comes across a collapsed woman. After helping her, she identifies her as a guitarist and introduces herself as Hiroi, a bassist. After hearing about Bocchi's situation, Hiroi invites her to perform a surprise street live together. The impromptu performance attracts a large audience and even results in a few ticket sales; two girls bought her tickets and so does Hiroi, but she still borrows the money from Bocchi for her ticket home.[19] The band members, except for Ryo, pay Bocchi a visit at her home to have a good time and discuss band-related matters. Things go \"well\" until the end when they all turn into dust.[20] When the date for their performance comes, unfortunately the weather was bad which caused a significant setback for the band as many people were unable to attend. Only the drunk woman and two girls from Bocchi's previous live performance showed up, which resulted in the band feeling demotivated. The live performance started poorly with the band feeling out of sync, but Bocchi stepped up with her leading guitar solo, which helped to remotivate them, which caused them to perform their next song exceptionally well.[21] They later celebrated their success with a feast at an izakaya. Before they went home, Nijika had a conversation with Bocchi, acknowledging her as guitarhero and giving her a new name, Bocchi the Rock.[22] Volume 2 In the summer holidays, Bocchi found herself spending most of her time playing the guitar and aimlessly browsing the internet until she grew tired of it. She then went to STARRY just to hold a funeral for cicadas. Upon learning that the band had not done anything together for almost the entire holiday, they decided to take a trip to Enoshima. This was particularly challenging since all but one of them preferred indoor activities. Despite the challenges, they had a good time, although Bocchi was attacked by the birds there.[23] When the application window for the school festival performance opened, Bocchi tried to apply for the band but found herself held back by her persistent anxiety. Seeking guidance from both her bandmates and the STARRY crew, she struggled to muster the courage to apply. Just when she thought she might give up, Kita revealed that she had already applied on their behalf, making Bocchi die on the inside (figuratively).[24] With the application now irrevocable, the pressure mounted as it cannot be canceled. Bocchi also faced a grueling exam session that left her feeling drained.[25] Though she just managed to pass, the looming festival weighed heavily on her mind. In search of motivation for the upcoming school festival live, Hiroi invited the band to witness her band's performance at FOLT, a live house. Bocchi found renewed determination after watching Hiroi and her band gave it their all on stage. The band members then practiced tirelessly for several days leading up to the festival.[26] On the day of the festival, Bocchi found herself in a difficult situation as she needed to dress up as a maid for their class café. She ran away before the café even started, but the other band members managed to track her down and take her to other stalls to have fun. However, Bocchi was still obligated to work at the café. They also rehearsed in the school gymnasium as their performance was scheduled for the second day of the festival.[27] In the school gymnasium on the second day of the festival, Kessoku Band started their performance, and Bocchi was filled with anxiety. Unfortunately, midway on the performance, she discovered that the first guitar string was severely out of tune during the performance, and had to constantly try to tune it during the first song. The situation worsened as the same string snapped during the second song; the second string could not be tuned due to a broken peg. With no time to waste, Bocchi improvised and used an empty cup of sake left by Hiroi, who was watching, to perform a slide guitar solo, which surprised the audience in a good way. After the performance ended, Kita gave Bocchi a space to talk during the MC session, but she didn't know what to say. So, she thought about what Hiroi would do and impulsively jumped off the stage, without anyone to catch her it resulted in Bocchi falling to the ground and losing consciousness. She was rushed to the infirmary, accompanied by Kita. The incident caused the students to remember her as the \"crazy rocker who dived,\" which made Bocchi very embarrassed.[28] Bocchi apologized to her father for the broken guitar and the incident at the school festival. Despite this, her father told her not to worry about it since it can still be fixed, but he suggested that she buy a new guitar. To her surprise, her father revealed that her guitarhero channel had earned her enough money (a total of 300,000 yen) to buy a new guitar. Although she initially tried to quit her part-time job, she eventually gave up. Along with her friends, Bocchi went to Ochanomizu in Shibuya to look for a new guitar. She finally decided on a custom Yamaha guitar, which the attendant advised her to take care of well.[29] Later, Nijika paid Bocchi a visit at her place and expressed her interest in watching Bocchi's guitarhero recordings. Upon viewing them together, Nijika brought up \"My New Gear,\" a user who flaunted a high-end guitar and later auctioned it off to purchase a newer model. They both discovered that Ryo also joined in on this trend. Nijika encouraged Bocchi to create a Twitta account, but unfortunately, Bocchi was unable to resist the \"Attention-Whore Monster\" in her mind, which begged for more likes. She ended up spending the remaining income from her channel on a lot of effects pedals just to garner attention. After realizing her poor decision-making skills, she became frustrated with her financial situation; and worst, found out that her failed stage dive had gone viral.[30] When Kessoku Band was preparing for their next live performance, they were surprised by the unexpected appearance of a young-looking girl named Poison♡Yami. She introduced herself as a writer for Band Lab. She interviewed the band, with a particular interest in Bocchi due to her previous viral fame. This caused some suspicion among the band members. Later, during their live performance, Poison♡Yami was among the audience and was amazed by Bocchi's guitar playing. She made a shocking revelation to everyone present—she was the person behind guitarhero channel.[31] Despite Nijika's efforts to conceal Bocchi's online identity (the only person who knows about Bocchi's online persona), Poison♡Yami pointed out several similarities between Bocchi's online and real-life appearances, leaving Bocchi feeling flustered. The rest of the bandmates did not react strongly, but Poison♡Yami accused Kessoku Band of not allowing Bocchi to reach her full potential as a guitarist and labeled them an average band. Seika and PA-san eventually chased Poison♡Yami out of the venue, threatening to expose her real identity to the public. Although the band didn't seem too affected by her accusations, Bocchi took them to heart and made a big decision: she and the band would join Mikakunin Riot together as Kessoku Band.[32] Relationships Nijika Ijichi Nijika played a significant role in Bocchi's exposure to band life and her social development, as she was the one to convince her to join the band. As the band's leader, she treated Bocchi with kindness and encouragement, along with the other members. Nijika was also a source of motivation for Bocchi, offering words of encouragement whenever she deemed it appropriate. Despite being a Guitarhero fan, Nijika was unaware that Bocchi was behind the channel when she first recruited her. However, her intuition eventually recognized the similarities and she pointed them out to Bocchi, who confirmed her claims. Nijika came to understand the truth and respected Bocchi's wish to keep her identity a secret. Nijika even witnessed Bocchi's musical prowess firsthand. When Poison♡Yami attempted to reveal Bocchi's identity, Nijika tried to defend her until Bocchi ultimately gave in. Ryo Yamada Ryo is responsible for giving Hitori her nickname \"Bocchi,\" and also named the band \"Kessoku Band.\" The two quickly became close friends after their first meeting, and Ryo used her experience from a previous band to help Bocchi find her role in Kessoku Band. Although both are introverted and quiet, Ryo is less anxious than Bocchi and tends to remain composed in stressful situations. However, Ryo has a habit of borrowing money from Bocchi, making promises to repay her, but often fails to do so due to financial difficulties. Additionally, when Bocchi experiences a mishap, Ryo sometimes laughs at her, although this is just playful teasing within their strong and supportive friendship. Ikuyo Kita Despite being strangers, they quickly became close friends as she was the one to recruit her back to Kessoku band and the one who taught her how to play the guitar. They also attended the same school and were in the same class during their second year. She was also the one who helped Kita reconcile with the other band members after her sudden disappearance. Although they have a strong friendship, they both have their own weaknesses. Bocchi feels insecure about her ability to make friends compared to Kita's outgoing personality, while Kita is insecure about Bocchi's talent and determination. Despite this, they rarely argue, except for the time when Kita became uncomfortable with Bocchi's obsession with keeping their band photo as tiled walls in her closet, which led her to distance herself from Bocchi for a few days. Kita is known for her politeness and addresses Bocchi by her last name, \"Gotoh-san.\" Later, as they became closer friends, Kita started calling her \"Hitori-chan.\" Kita is also aware of Bocchi's social anxiety and wants to help her overcome it. However, her attempts sometimes end up making things worse for Bocchi, such as when she gave her a chance to speak during their cultural festival live, which resulted in Bocchi's stage dive incident. Despite this, neither Bocchi nor Kita seem to dwell on these mishaps. Seika Ijichi At first, Bocchi was intimidated by Seika's unfriendly and strict personality when she first joined STARRY. Seika's demeanor often made Bocchi nervous about her job and performance. However, Seika actually considers Bocchi to be a great person with untapped potential as both a guitarist and as an individual. Unfortunately, Seika struggles to effectively communicate these thoughts to Bocchi, which has left Bocchi largely unaware of Seika's true feelings. While their relationship is primarily that of employer and employee, there are moments when they do genuinely care for each other. Kikuri Hiroi Kikuri is like an older sister to Bocchi, who greatly admires Hiroi's skills as a bassist. Their first meeting was during a street live performance in Kanazawa-Hakken, where Hiroi's encouraging words helped Bocchi learn a lot. Hiroi also recognized Bocchi's potential as a guitarist and became a huge supporter of her band, attending all of their performances. However, Bocchi is not fond of Hiroi's behavior off-stage, as she sometimes causes trouble for the crowd due to her excessive drinking. Hiroi also has a tendency to borrow money from Bocchi and others, which can be frustrating. Futari Gotoh Bocchi finds it challenging to get along with Futari because of their contrasting personalities. She often feels hurt by Futari's blunt comments and inferiority due to being placed at the lowest tier of the \"Futari Family Pyramid.\" Despite this, their sibling relationship remains positive, and Futari occasionally shows support toward Bocchi. Naoki Gotoh Naoki played a significant role in Bocchi's guitar journey as he allowed her to borrow his guitar and even set up her guitarhero channel. Being a former musician himself, Naoki understands the struggles that come with learning an instrument, and he always provides Bocchi with helpful advice and support whenever she faces difficulties. He is Bocchi's most expressive supporter among all her family members and often records her performances on his camcorder during events or occasions. However, Naoki tends to be brutally honest with his opinions, which sometimes includes not believing in Bocchi's ability to make friends through her music because of his impression of her. Despite this, his intentions are always well-meaning, and he truly wants the best for Bocchi. Michiyo Gotoh Bocchi's mother is known for being both nurturing and strict towards her daughter. She has always been supportive of Bocchi's interests and activities, while also providing constructive criticism when necessary. Despite her understanding of Bocchi's social struggles, she never hesitates to address any problematic behaviors, whether they occur in Bocchi's personal life or band activities. While she tends to be honest about her views of Bocchi with others, she never scolds Bocchi for her introverted tendencies. Instead, she encourages her to step out of her comfort zone while also respecting her boundaries. Nijika Ijichi (伊い地じ知ち 虹にじ夏か Ijichi Nijika) is one of the main characters in the manga and anime series, Bocchi the Rock!. She is a second-year student of Shimokitazawa High School and is the drummer in the band, Kessoku Band. Contents 1 Character information 2 Appearance 3 Personality 4 Plot 4.1 History 4.2 Volume 1 5 Relationship 5.1 Hitori Gotoh 5.2 Ryo Yamada 6 Etymology 7 Trivia 8 References Character information An energetic and cheerful second-year high school student. She is the drummer of Kessoku Band. The organizer of her band who takes care of Hitori was already joined Kessoku Band. She has an older sister, Seika, who is the manager of the live house \"STARRY\" and has a special feeling for the live house.[5] Appearance Nijika has long blonde hair with a floating, triangular ahoge worn in a side ponytail and vermilion eyes. In her uniform, she wears a white long-sleeve uniform with a tucked skirt and red ribbon with big polka dots, a dark blue pleated skirt, white socks, and red sneakers with white laces. Personality Nijika is a kind, sweet and friendly girl. She is outgoing, yet also very accommodating and makes others feel at ease. She was exposed to band culture at an early age due to the influence of her older sister, Seika, who was once in a band and is now the manager of a live house, and is familiar with the music industry . Nijika is selfless by nature and does her best to support others. Indeed, not only does she work at \"STARRY\" out of gratitude towards her older sister, but she also holds the group together and alongside Kita, helps Hitori overcome her social anxiety. She also makes an effort to keep her best friend, Ryo Yamada in check whenever she's up to no good. Indeed, despite her kindness, Nijika can be a bit of a tsundere towards her sister due to her stern attitude, and also towards Ryo and Kikuri, who often annoy her with their antics. She is good at designing, and produces the logo for Kessoku Band as well as their CD covers. She also edits the video footage of concerts to post online. Nijika was a fan of \"guitarhero\", and eventually realizes that she was actually Hitori, but this makes her become more confident of achieving her dream. Until it was revealed to everyone by Poison♡Yami, she kept it a secret from other members. Plot History Originally she was under the care of her mother who used to dote on her. Her sister, Seika also used to play a lot with her. However after Seika formed a band, she ended up neglecting her family and ultimately left the house, which made Nijika sad and angry. As a result, she came to hate bands because she felt they stole her sister from her. Her mother was the only one taking care of her at this point. However, her mother died in an accident, and Nijika, worried that nobody would care of her after that, refused to go outside or even go to school, which concerned her father. He urged Seika return home to take care of her. Seika, realizing her mistakes, finally decided to spend more time with Nijika. She later brought Nijika to see her band perform in a live house. After seeing their performance, Nijika reopened her heart to her sister and was inspired to play music. Although compared to the guitar, she prefers drums because they look cooler.[6] This also led Seika to quit her band and establish STARRY, where they started to live and work. Seeing that her sister had sacrificed a lot and that she wanted to become better at drumming, she was determined to form a band herself. She managed to recruit her classmate, Ryo Yamada, and subsequently a certain guitar-vocalist, who shortly afterwards, would abruptly quit. Volume 1 Nijika met a girl in a pink tracksuit in a certain playground, and approached her after noticing her guitar. She asked if she could fill in for her guitarist who ran off. The girl was startled by her presence and was in a panic, but Nijika managed to introduce herself and convey her request to the girl, to which she reluctantly agreed. Nijika then brought the girl to STARRY, and introduced her to Ryo who had already arrived. She and Ryo talked with the girl to get to know her a bit more, who then introduced herself as Hitori Gotoh. Nijika hesitantly agreed with Ryo's proposed nickname \"Bocchi(-chan)\". She also commented about the band name, which is a terrible pun. They later had a live session together and Bocchi officially joined the band. Meeting again at STARRY, Nijika initiates topics of conversation by playing dice. They discuss their favorite songs (in which she mentioned liking melodic hardcore and punk rock), school, and especially about the band. She explained to Bocchi about the quota system, and how they really need money in order to perform. She suggested working part time to Bocchi which throws her again in a state of panic, so she offered Bocchi to work with them together in STARRY. Come Bocchi's first day on the job, she helped Bocchi by showing her the ropes. She was satisfied by Bocchi's work despite all her mistakes, but as long as Bocchi could overcome her current state step by step, she was already happy enough. One day, she got a message from Bocchi to \"dance wildly with an energy drink on her hand\" in an attempt to make the live house looks more lively for a certain guest. Nijika bought a lot of energy drinks for that, only to notice that Bocchi brought Kita - the runaway guitar-vocalist of the band. Kita apologized for her abrupt departure and explained her reason, but Nijika had no trouble with her. In order to promote the band, Nijika suggested the band shoot a professional photograph outside. After multiple suggestions of the kind of photo they wanted, they decided to do the \"jump style\" where according to Ryo, it is a powerful shot for an anime. She felt a \"youth sensation\" with that style and felt optimistic for the band's future. Nijika asked about the band's next live only to be rejected by Seika, who explained that the band would need to pass an audition in order to perform. They did so, and passed, allowing them to hold their first live Afterward, Nijika and Kita went to Bocchi's house to visit and talk about the band, where they met Bocchi's little sister, Futari, and noted how different she and her sister were. They tried to design T-shirts for Kessoku Band. However, they weren't able to come to a consensus, and opted for a basic shirt with the band's logo instead. On the day of the live, they were hampered by a rainstorm, which resulted in a low turnout from their ticket buyers. Nijika and Kita tried to cheer up the somber mood in the house during the MC session to no avail. Everything went wrong until Bocchi stepped up with her solo, which brought the band's spirits up, giving them the boost they needed to perform better. After the celebratory feast at an izakaya, Nijika reveals to Bocchi that she realized her identity as \"guitarhero. She also give Bocchi her title \"Bocchi the Rock\". Relationship Hitori Gotoh Nijika establishes herself as a trustworthy friend towards Bocchi, as well as a good band leader of Kessoku Band. She always helped her dealing with her anxiety shenanigans, and always be the one that devises the plan to improve Bocchi's social skill to be better like having her working part time together in STARRY or be the one that suggest to visit her house. In fact Nijika is viewed as the main reason why Bocchi managed to get out from her shell and performs in a band - due to her did not hesitate to invite Bocchi to join Kessoku Band despite being originally an outsider and Nijika does not even know Bocchi's online identity yet that time. Even when Nijika finally know about it, she cared more about how to make Bocchi comfortable with that fact and not too sensitive towards it. Ryo Yamada Originally a classmate, Nijika's non-hesitation towards Ryo to invite her is also the main reason Ryo is back being in a band. Since then, they established a close relationship between each other. Despite all the troubles Ryo caused to her, their relationship remains good and close that even Ryo cannot stand being alone from her and be the one that has her easily give a smile when talking. Etymology The name Nijika means \"rainbow\" (虹 niji) and \"summer\" (夏 ka). Nijika's surname Ijichi means \"that\" (伊 i), \"earth, ground\" (地 ji) and \"know, wisdom\" (知 chi).

She has good motor skills and can study safely, but she also thinks she is a mediocre person with no special excellence compared to Ryo. She hates her first name and would strongly prefers to be called by her last name. Her name actually sounds the same as \"Came\" (きた Kita) and \"Let's go\"/\"I'm going\"/\"I'm coming\" (行くよ Ikuyo).[8] While living a daily life that felt fun but mediocre, when she saw Ryo at a concert performance on the street of the band she used to belong to, she admired her, saying, \"I'm jealous of walking on an unusual road.\" Although she applied as a guitarist to add to the initial members of Kessoku Band, she escaped from the band just before her first concert because she couldn't play the guitar. She later reconciled herself by reuniting with Ryo and revealing her truth. When Hitori persuaded her, she joined Kessoku Band again. Although she has little experience in playing and is technically immature, as a result of practicing under the guidance of Hitori at the school festival concert, she showed that she had grown up to connect time with ad-lib for Hitori who had a problem with the equipment. Initially, she addressed Hitori as \"Gotoh-san\", but at the school festival concert, she started using \"Hitori-chan\" instead.

Bocchi later invited Kita to her band, in which due to her record of running away, she refused, but asked Bocchi to teach her guitar instead. Bocchi wanted to refuse due to her commitments with STARRY, but Kita wanted to follow her otherwise. However that's where things got revealed to Kita later on when knowing Bocchi is working in Shimokitazawa and become afraid when the way Bocchi is going is similar to where the old band was and refused to go further - and Nijika catching them up made it worst for her when she get caught running away from her. Kita later admitted about how she was in the wrong, lying and leaving without telling anything. Kita later joins the crew in STARRY working to serve drinks there and wore the maid dress which somehow kept by Seika all this time. Originally Nijika asked Bocchi to show her the ropes, but Kita ended up helping Bocchi instead. During work, she also explained the real reason she joined Kessoku Band because of her admiration towards Ryo. Kita ended up rejoining Kessoku Band after the work. Not long after, the rest of the band discovered that the reason why Kita couldn't play guitar in the first place was because the \"guitar\" she bought and tried to practice with was actually a six-string bass, much to her dismay. Fortunately for her, Ryo bought up the bass (making her penniless once again), and let Kita borrow her guitar indefinitely. Kita and Bocchi has a regular guitar training later on, and revealed about her having an Isosta account and being active at it during the photoshoot. When Seika challenged the band for an audition, they passed decently, Kita came together with Nijika to Bocchi's house to visit her and talk about the band's design on their t-shirts, as well as they get to know Futari and Jimihen and play with her. They got cursed by Bocchi later on, trying to change her appearance. Kita was hampered her friends can't come to the band live due to the rainstorm, and her dull MC session doesn't help much with the crowd. However Bocchi stepped up motivating the whole band, which made their live ending well. In the izakaya where they had their celebratory dinner, Kita broke when her first name got mentioned by Ryo due to how punny it is. Relationship Hitori Gotoh Hitori Gotoh/Bocchi is a schoolmate of hers, and later in their second year, a classmate. They first met accidentally when Bocchi was scouting for another member of Kessoku Band. Despite her already running away from the band, Bocchi managed to bring her back to the band (per some surprising turns of events) and eventually picked up guitar lessons with her. From there, she build her trust in Bocchi and the rest of the band, and eventually became close to each other, to the point of first-name calling with her. She also would not hesitate to share her problems with Bocchi and other band members where she could confess everything and seek help. Kita is considered the closest person to Bocchi, given that their being schoolmates and later classmates means she is able to interact and watch on her more than the other bandmates. She is aware of Bocchi's social problems and tried hard to cover and help Bocchi go through her school days with that. Although sometimes she is the reason why situations Bocchi had become worse, Bocchi has no hard feelings toward her. In fact, despite her shortcomings, Kita helped Bocchi to be better known in their school with them participating in the cultural festival and helped her become closer to her other schoolmates as well, and the reason why Bocchi managed to get close with Tsuguko Sasaki, Kita's classmate since her middle school. Nijika Ijichi Her friendship with Nijika is such of a bandmate, where she first met Nijika when she joins Kessoku Band. Despite Kita being the one putting the band in a pinch due to her suddenly quit from the band, Nijika has no hard feelings toward her and understands her situation well, and has no issue having her back in the band. Kita and Nijika remain friends in the band since then, with Nijika assisting Kita when necessary and opening her ears to all complaints and confessions from her. Ryo Yamada Kita first knew Ryo when Ryo was still in her old band. Her cool and androgynous aura is what make Kita admire her so much back then, and Kita even went as far as joining Kessoku Band when she heard the news that Ryo joins the band and it still has open positions. During their first meetings, Kita tend to be head over heels for her, but over time when she managed to get to know her closer to the point that she knows some of Ryo's bad traits as well, her fanaticism towards Ryo subsided. She and Ryo now remain friends in the band and Kita still has her high admiration towards her, but now in a proper manner as a bandmate. Ryo always assisted Kita when necessary and helped by giving her advice at times, and do not really mind her fanaticism and even her running away from the band. Etymology The name Ikuyo means \"fragrant, cultured\" (郁 iku) and \"world, age\" (代 yo). Ikuyo's surname Kita means \"joy\" (喜 ki) and \"many\" (多 ta). Trivia Her surname is derived from Kensuke Kita. Her birthday, April 21 (4/21) is a reverse reading of his birthday, January 24 (1/24). Despite deriving her name to Kensuke Kita, Kita's role in a band was more related to Masafumi Gotoh, the rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION. Her guitar is a 1959 Gibson Les Paul Junior DC in Pelham Blue finish. Her pedal board consists of a Polytune, a Boss BD-2 Blues Driver, and a Pro Co RAT in that order. She did not appear as one of the main characters until chapter 5. In the anime, she appears instantly in \"Lonely Rolling Bocchi\". Her Isosta account is @kita0421 in \"Jumping Girl(s)\". Her first name is revealed in chapter 13 for the manga and episode 8 for the anime. Her infamous \"omnidirectional 3rd finger\" from the third ending animation in the anime series became popular on fandom. According to the ending animator Haruka Suzuki, Kita was actually raising her index finger, as supposed to the alleged 3rd finger.[9] On the last page of chapter 66, she carries the athlete's foot with her (taken out by Bocchi when she wants to escape due to her athlete's foot). As a result, many fans criticized about she has athlete's foot.[10][11]"

                Hitori started playing the guitar in her first year of middle school and improved her skills by practicing six hours daily. Although, after she had graduated from middle school and begun attending Shuka High School, she still had no friends at the start of the series.[9]
                Volume 1
                Hitori was playing her guitar in her house while lamenting in an internal monologue about how she was on the brink of becoming a hikikomori, a shut off from society due to her social issues. She found comfort in the comments people left on her \"guitarhero\" video channel, but when someone suggested she perform live, her motivation dropped. She thought back to her middle school days when she tried and failed to make friends through her love for \"rock\". She dreamed of forming a band and performing live, but it seemed like a distant fantasy. The next day, she showed up at Shuka High School with her guitar and band merchandise, but no one seemed interested. Feeling down, she wandered around Shimokitazawa, ending up on a swing in a nearby playground, and bemoaned her bad luck. Suddenly, a girl approached her, and she introduced herself as Nijika Ijichi. Noticing her guitar, she asked Hitori to be a substitute for their band's recent runaway guitarist. Hitori reluctantly agreed and Nijika took her to a live house called STARRY. On the way, Nijika rambled on about herself, making it hard for Hitori to listen. But when Nijika mentioned the \"guitarhero\" channel and how she wished to play with the creator, Hitori was surprised and grateful that someone liked her work.\n
                When they arrived in STARRY, Nijika introduced Hitori to Ryo Yamada, who was already inside.[10] The live house and its staff were so gloomy that Hitori was afraid and hid in a trash can. When they started to practice, Hitori was very bad, which dampened her motivation despite her impressive performances as guitarhero. To boost her confidence, Ryo suggested that she hide in a mango box to calm down, and surprisingly worked. She felt much better and was able to perform well in the live show. Ryo also explained the band's name, Kessoku Band, and gave her the nickname \"Bocchi(-chan).\" Although Hitori was just in a box, she felt optimistic playing with the band and believed that improving her social skills was crucial to showcasing her potential as guitarhero.[11]\n
                On the following day, Bocchi shared with the band her avoidance of people, revealing how she travels 2 hours to school to avoid meeting anyone she knows, and how happy songs make her feel like she is missing out on youth. When Nijika brought up the band's financial situation and the need to work part-time, Bocchi was hesitant to give up her savings and feared the idea of working. Nijika then offered her a job at the live house instead, which Bocchi reluctantly accepted but still searched for the odds of winning the lottery to avoid her responsibility.[12] On her first day of work, Bocchi tried to skip it by resorting to bathing in cold water and sitting in front of a blowing fan but failed. Her nervousness gets in the way even right before she entered the live house until the manager noticed her and got her mistaken as a customer. The whole day passed with a lot of mishaps on her part, but it went well nevertheless, and Nijika compliments her for taking a step forward. She managed to get herself excited for the next day, but her excitement for the next day was ruined by a fever that struck her at the wrong time.[13]
                \nShe came back to school frustrated with her anxiety hindering her communication until she stumbled upon a cheerful girl. She tried getting her attention to get the girl to join her band but ended up running away herself. After a proper explanation, Kita initially declined due to her previous experience with a certain band but asked Bocchi if she could teach her guitar. Bocchi agreed and even brought Kita to her part-time job, only to discover that it was at the very same live house where her old band played and where the former Kessoku Band vocalist quit.[14] Despite feeling overwhelmed by Kita's presence when she joined the crew on her job, Bocchi showed her the ropes on the job and they developed a mutual understanding. Finally, Kita rejoined the band.[15]
                \nIn the following events, Bocchi \"enjoyed\" teaching Kita how to play the guitar, working her part-time job, and having photoshoots with the group.[16] The band asked her to write lyrics for a new song, but Bocchi struggled to come up with an idea that she was satisfied with. After receiving guidance from Ryo, she finally finished the lyrics, which the band liked and approved of.[17] When Seika puts the band for their upcoming live performance, the band passed, but Bocchi became overwhelmed and vomited due to the stress. Seika saw this and offered constructive criticism to her, commenting such as that she often looks down, hoping to help Bocchi improve, but Bocchi misinterpreted her comments as a threat.[18]
                \nBocchi encounters a dead end when trying to sell her tickets for their performance. She finds herself reflecting on her situation where suddenly she comes across a collapsed woman. After helping her, she identifies her as a guitarist and introduces herself as Hiroi, a bassist. After hearing about Bocchi's situation, Hiroi invites her to perform a surprise street live together. The impromptu performance attracts a large audience and even results in a few ticket sales; two girls bought her tickets and so does Hiroi, but she still borrows the money from Bocchi for her ticket home.[19] The band members, except for Ryo, pay Bocchi a visit at her home to have a good time and discuss band-related matters. Things go \"well\" until the end when they all turn into dust.[20]
                When the date for their performance comes, unfortunately the weather was bad which caused a significant setback for the band as many people were unable to attend. Only the drunk woman and two girls from Bocchi's previous live performance showed up, which resulted in the band feeling demotivated. The live performance started poorly with the band feeling out of sync, but Bocchi stepped up with her leading guitar solo, which helped to remotivate them, which caused them to perform their next song exceptionally well.[21] They later celebrated their success with a feast at an izakaya. Before they went home, Nijika had a conversation with Bocchi, acknowledging her as guitarhero and giving her a new name, Bocchi the Rock.[22]
                \nVolume 2
                In the summer holidays, Bocchi found herself spending most of her time playing the guitar and aimlessly browsing the internet until she grew tired of it. She then went to STARRY just to hold a funeral for cicadas. Upon learning that the band had not done anything together for almost the entire holiday, they decided to take a trip to Enoshima. This was particularly challenging since all but one of them preferred indoor activities. Despite the challenges, they had a good time, although Bocchi was attacked by the birds there.[23]
                When the application window for the school festival performance opened, Bocchi tried to apply for the band but found herself held back by her persistent anxiety. Seeking guidance from both her bandmates and the STARRY crew, she struggled to muster the courage to apply. Just when she thought she might give up, Kita revealed that she had already applied on their behalf, making Bocchi die on the inside (figuratively).[24] With the application now irrevocable, the pressure mounted as it cannot be canceled. Bocchi also faced a grueling exam session that left her feeling drained.[25] Though she just managed to pass, the looming festival weighed heavily on her mind.
                In search of motivation for the upcoming school festival live, Hiroi invited the band to witness her band's performance at FOLT, a live house. Bocchi found renewed determination after watching Hiroi and her band gave it their all on stage. The band members then practiced tirelessly for several days leading up to the festival.[26] On the day of the festival, Bocchi found herself in a difficult situation as she needed to dress up as a maid for their class café. She ran away before the café even started, but the other band members managed to track her down and take her to other stalls to have fun. However, Bocchi was still obligated to work at the café. They also rehearsed in the school gymnasium as their performance was scheduled for the second day of the festival.[27]
                In the school gymnasium on the second day of the festival, Kessoku Band started their performance, and Bocchi was filled with anxiety. Unfortunately, midway on the performance, she discovered that the first guitar string was severely out of tune during the performance, and had to constantly try to tune it during the first song. The situation worsened as the same string snapped during the second song; the second string could not be tuned due to a broken peg. With no time to waste, Bocchi improvised and used an empty cup of sake left by Hiroi, who was watching, to perform a slide guitar solo, which surprised the audience in a good way. After the performance ended, Kita gave Bocchi a space to talk during the MC session, but she didn't know what to say. So, she thought about what Hiroi would do and impulsively jumped off the stage, without anyone to catch her it resulted in Bocchi falling to the ground and losing consciousness. She was rushed to the infirmary, accompanied by Kita. The incident caused the students to remember her as the \"crazy rocker who dived,\" which made Bocchi very embarrassed.[28]
                Bocchi apologized to her father for the broken guitar and the incident at the school festival. Despite this, her father told her not to worry about it since it can still be fixed, but he suggested that she buy a new guitar. To her surprise, her father revealed that her guitarhero channel had earned her enough money (a total of 300,000 yen) to buy a new guitar. Although she initially tried to quit her part-time job, she eventually gave up. Along with her friends, Bocchi went to Ochanomizu in Shibuya to look for a new guitar. She finally decided on a custom Yamaha guitar, which the attendant advised her to take care of well.[29]
                Later, Nijika paid Bocchi a visit at her place and expressed her interest in watching Bocchi's guitarhero recordings. Upon viewing them together, Nijika brought up \"My New Gear,\" a user who flaunted a high-end guitar and later auctioned it off to purchase a newer model. They both discovered that Ryo also joined in on this trend. Nijika encouraged Bocchi to create a Twitta account, but unfortunately, Bocchi was unable to resist the \"Attention-Whore Monster\" in her mind, which begged for more likes. She ended up spending the remaining income from her channel on a lot of effects pedals just to garner attention. After realizing her poor decision-making skills, she became frustrated with her financial situation; and worst, found out that her failed stage dive had gone viral.[30]
                When Kessoku Band was preparing for their next live performance, they were surprised by the unexpected appearance of a young-looking girl named Poison♡Yami. She introduced herself as a writer for Band Lab. She interviewed the band, with a particular interest in Bocchi due to her previous viral fame. This caused some suspicion among the band members. Later, during their live performance, Poison♡Yami was among the audience and was amazed by Bocchi's guitar playing. She made a shocking revelation to everyone present—she was the person behind guitarhero channel.[31]
                Despite Nijika's efforts to conceal Bocchi's online identity (the only person who knows about Bocchi's online persona), Poison♡Yami pointed out several similarities between Bocchi's online and real-life appearances, leaving Bocchi feeling flustered. The rest of the bandmates did not react strongly, but Poison♡Yami accused Kessoku Band of not allowing Bocchi to reach her full potential as a guitarist and labeled them an average band. Seika and PA-san eventually chased Poison♡Yami out of the venue, threatening to expose her real identity to the public. Although the band didn't seem too affected by her accusations, Bocchi took them to heart and made a big decision: she and the band would join Mikakunin Riot together as Kessoku Band.[32]
